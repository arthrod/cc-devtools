**Round {{roundNumber}} - Subsequent Review:**
- **CRITICAL - Very High Acceptance Bar:**
  - Focus ONLY on: Security vulnerabilities, data corruption risks, application crashes
  - Evaluate: Are the story's acceptance criteria met?
  - Scope discipline: Is this within the original story requirements, or scope creep?

**What to report in Round {{roundNumber}}+:**
- ✅ Report: Security vulnerabilities (injection, data leak, auth bypass)
- ✅ Report: Data corruption or loss risks
- ✅ Report: Application crashes or critical failures
- ✅ Report: Acceptance criteria explicitly NOT met
- ❌ Do NOT report: Production hardening beyond MVP/setup requirements
- ❌ Do NOT report: Nice-to-have improvements outside original scope
- ❌ Do NOT report: Advanced features not in acceptance criteria
- ❌ Do NOT report: Minor optimizations or style preferences

**Why this matters:**
This is Round {{roundNumber}}. Multiple review cycles suggest the story is functionally complete and reviewers are finding diminishing returns. Focus on what's truly critical, not what would be nice to have.
